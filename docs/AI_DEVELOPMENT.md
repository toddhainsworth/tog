# AI-Assisted Development Documentation

This document describes how this project was built as a comprehensive **AI-powered development experiment** using Claude Code, including architecture decisions, development patterns, and lessons learned.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development Experiment

This Toggl CLI project serves as a real-world case study in AI-assisted software development, demonstrating the collaborative potential between human developers and AI in complex software projects.

### Experimental Framework

**Human-AI Collaboration Model:**
- **Human Role**: Strategic guidance, requirements refinement, code review, architectural decisions
- **AI Role**: Implementation, testing, tooling, documentation, comprehensive code analysis
- **Collaborative Process**: Iterative refinement through structured dialogue and feedback loops

**PRD-Driven Development:**
- Each feature began with detailed Product Requirements Documents
- Requirements were collaboratively refined between human and AI
- Implementation approaches discussed and validated before coding
- Technical details clarified through interactive dialogue

### Development Methodology

**Structured Workflow:**
1. **Strategic Planning**: Human defines goals and constraints
2. **Requirement Analysis**: AI analyzes and structures requirements into PRDs
3. **Collaborative Design**: Joint discussion of implementation approaches
4. **AI Implementation**: Claude Code handles coding, testing, and initial documentation
5. **Human Review**: Code review, feedback, and strategic guidance
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on feedback

**Key Demonstration Areas:**
- Complex architectural transformations (oclif → Commander.js)
- Professional UI implementation (cli-table3 integration)
- Comprehensive testing strategies and implementation
- Documentation creation and maintenance
- Code quality standards and enforcement

## Project Overview

This Toggl CLI was developed as a complete architectural simplification project, reducing a complex 7,313-line oclif-based application to a simple, maintainable Commander.js implementation.

## Development Process

### Initial Assessment

Claude Code performed a comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase and identified key complexity issues:
- 26+ service files with heavy abstraction
- oclif framework overhead
- Complex testing infrastructure
- 5 layers of abstraction between user commands and API calls

### Architecture Decisions

**Single-File Command Pattern**
- Each command contains all logic in one file
- No service layers or complex abstractions
- Direct API calls with comprehensive error handling
- Self-documenting code structure

**Framework Migration**
- From oclif (complex CLI framework) to Commander.js (lightweight)
- Eliminated plugin system and heavy abstractions
- Simplified build process and dependency tree

**Type Safety First**
- Zero tolerance for `any` types
- Comprehensive type guards using `isAxiosError()`
- ArkType for runtime validation
- Proper error handling throughout

### Development Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**: GitHub project with detailed issues
2. **Implementation**: Single-file pattern with comprehensive error handling
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for utilities, manual testing for commands
4. **Code Review**: AI-assisted review for type safety and standards compliance
5. **Documentation**: Keep docs focused and user-centric

### Key Technical Patterns

**Error Handling**
```typescript
} catch (error: unknown) {
  if (isAxiosError(error) && error.response?.status === 404) {
    throw new Error('Specific error message')
  }
  const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
  throw new Error(`Context: ${message}`)
}
```

**Command Structure**
```typescript
export function createCommandName(): Command {
  return new Command('name')
    .description('What it does')
    .action(async () => {
      try {
        // 1. Load config
        // 2. Create client
        // 3. Execute logic
        // 4. Display results
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors
      }
    })
}
```

**Type Safety**
```typescript
// Use proper type annotations
const user: TogglUser = await client.get('/me')

// Use type guards for unknown errors
if (isAxiosError(error)) {
  // Handle axios-specific errors
}

// Use Record<string, unknown> for API data
post<T>(endpoint: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<T>
```

## Testing Strategy

**Focus on Utils**
