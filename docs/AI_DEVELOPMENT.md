# AI-Assisted Development Documentation

This document describes how this project was built using AI-assisted development with Claude Code, including architecture decisions, development patterns, and lessons learned.

## Project Overview

This Toggl CLI was developed as a complete architectural simplification project, reducing a complex 7,313-line oclif-based application to a simple, maintainable Commander.js implementation.

## Development Process

### Initial Assessment

Claude Code performed a comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase and identified key complexity issues:
- 26+ service files with heavy abstraction
- oclif framework overhead
- Complex testing infrastructure
- 5 layers of abstraction between user commands and API calls

### Architecture Decisions

**Single-File Command Pattern**
- Each command contains all logic in one file
- No service layers or complex abstractions
- Direct API calls with comprehensive error handling
- Self-documenting code structure

**Framework Migration**
- From oclif (complex CLI framework) to Commander.js (lightweight)
- Eliminated plugin system and heavy abstractions
- Simplified build process and dependency tree

**Type Safety First**
- Zero tolerance for `any` types
- Comprehensive type guards using `isAxiosError()`
- ArkType for runtime validation
- Proper error handling throughout

### Development Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**: GitHub project with detailed issues
2. **Implementation**: Single-file pattern with comprehensive error handling
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for utilities, manual testing for commands
4. **Code Review**: AI-assisted review for type safety and standards compliance
5. **Documentation**: Keep docs focused and user-centric

### Key Technical Patterns

**Error Handling**
```typescript
} catch (error: unknown) {
  if (isAxiosError(error) && error.response?.status === 404) {
    throw new Error('Specific error message')
  }
  const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
  throw new Error(`Context: ${message}`)
}
```

**Command Structure**
```typescript
export function createCommandName(): Command {
  return new Command('name')
    .description('What it does')
    .action(async () => {
      try {
        // 1. Load config
        // 2. Create client
        // 3. Execute logic
        // 4. Display results
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors
      }
    })
}
```

**Type Safety**
```typescript
// Use proper type annotations
const user: TogglUser = await client.get('/me')

// Use type guards for unknown errors
if (isAxiosError(error)) {
  // Handle axios-specific errors
}

// Use Record<string, unknown> for API data
post<T>(endpoint: string, data?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<T>
```

## Testing Strategy

**Focus on Utils**
- Comprehensive unit tests for utility functions (37 tests)
- Edge case testing and error conditions
- Commands tested manually following project policy

**Test Quality**
- Type-safe test implementations
- Realistic data and scenarios
- Performance and precision testing for time calculations

## Development Tools

**Core Dependencies**
- Commander.js: Lightweight CLI framework
- axios: HTTP client with type guards
- dayjs: Reliable time handling
- arktype: Runtime type validation
- @inquirer/prompts: Interactive CLI prompts

**Development Dependencies**
- TypeScript: Strict type checking
- Mocha/Chai: Testing framework
- ts-node: TypeScript execution

## Architecture Benefits

**For Users**
- Fast, responsive CLI
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive interactive prompts
- Simple installation and setup

**For Developers**
- Single-file commands are immediately understandable
- No hidden abstractions or service layers
- Fast development cycle with sub-second builds
- Easy to contribute with minimal learning curve

**For Maintainers**
- Dramatically reduced codebase size
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Comprehensive error handling

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

1. **Single-File Commands**: Massively improved readability and maintainability
2. **Type Safety First**: Zero `any` types prevented many potential bugs
3. **Direct API Integration**: Eliminated unnecessary abstraction layers
4. **Interactive Prompts**: Better UX than complex CLI flag combinations
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Every error path considered and tested

### Development Efficiency

- **AI Code Review**: Systematic review for type safety and standards compliance
- **Incremental Implementation**: Build and test each command independently
- **Documentation-Driven**: Keep docs simple and user-focused
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus testing efforts where they provide most value

### Architecture Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Direct, understandable code
2. **Simplicity over Abstraction**: Eliminate unnecessary layers
3. **Type Safety over Flexibility**: Strict typing prevents errors
4. **User Experience over Technical Purity**: Interactive prompts beat complex flags
5. **Maintainability over Performance**: Readable code is sustainable code

## Future Development

This architecture provides a solid foundation for:
- Adding new commands using the established pattern
- Extending functionality without increasing complexity
- Maintaining type safety as the project grows
- Onboarding new contributors quickly

The single-file command pattern scales well and can accommodate additional features while maintaining the core principles of simplicity and clarity.
